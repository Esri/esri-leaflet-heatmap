# Changelog

## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [2.0.0]

### Breaking Changes

* Namespace change (~~`L.esri.Heatmap.heatmapFeatureLayer`~~ is now `L.esri.Heatmap.featureLayer` )
* repository and npm package have been renamed esri-leaflet-heatmap~~-feature-layer~~ for brevity's sake

### Added

* The build system has been refactored to use latest Rollup and Rollup plugins.
* Reworked bundling directives for various modules systems to resolve and simplify various issues
  * WebPack users no longer have to use the Babel loader.
  * Babelify with Babel 6 now works

### Removed

* `bindPopup` and `unbindPopup` logic have been removed from this plugin.  Equivalent functionality is available via [`L.Layer`](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.0.html#layer-bindpopup) in Leaflet itself.

```js
clusterLayer.bindPopup(function (layer) {
  return "attribute value is: " + layer.feature.properties.ATTRIBUTENAME;
})
```
